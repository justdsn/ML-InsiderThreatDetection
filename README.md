# Machine Learning Approach for Insider Threat Detection

Machine learning pipeline for detecting insider threats using email and psychometric data. This project leverages the **Isolation Forest** algorithm to identify anomalous user behaviors, analyzing email activity, personality traits, and user-PC interactions.

## Features
- **Core Analysis**: Processes email data to detect anomalies based on email frequency, size, and attachments.
- **Extended Analysis**: Incorporates psychometric data (Big Five traits) and bipartite graph features for user-PC interactions.
- **Visualizations**: Generates scatter plots, time-series plots, heatmaps, and box plots for insights.
